Text summarization is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which can be described as the process of creating a compressed representation of a text document which conveys the main ideas of the document (Tohalino & Amancio, 2017). The goal of automatic text summarization is to condense electronic information (Laxmi & Venkata, 2017). For a given document containing of a set of sentences S, the aim of extractive text summarization is to select top k sentences that covers the main idea expressed in that document (Nikolov, Pfieffer & Hahnloser, 2018). The abstractive approach on the other hand applies sophisticated technique to generate a summary for the document which may contains words that are not found in the document, (Prateek, 2018). Extractive text summarization selects  a set of sentences from a document that conveys the main ideas expressed in that document and uses it as its summary.

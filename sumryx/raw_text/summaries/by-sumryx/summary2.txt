Manually creating summaries can be a time-consuming activity. When the volume of documents to be summarized becomes much, it becomes cumbersome to summarize these manually. It also aims at producing summaries that covers the main ideas expressed in a passage. Since documents are usually structured in such a way that different ideas are expressed at different sections (Rananavare & Reddy, 2017), the proposed system utilizes text clustering as a technique to handle this information spread as well reducing redundancy in the produced summaries by clustering sentences that most alike together and then picking a representative sentence from each cluster.

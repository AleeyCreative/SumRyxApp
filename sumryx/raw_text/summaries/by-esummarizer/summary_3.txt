The proposed system consist of uses text clustering as a precursor to text summarization in order to create extractive summaries.Since documents are usually structured in such a way that different ideas are expressed at different sections (Rananavare & Reddy, 2017), the proposed system utilizes text clustering as a technique to handle this information spread as well reducing redundancy in the produced summaries by clustering sentences that most alike together and then picking a representative sentence from each cluster.The system is also intended to provide an  interface that may be easily integrated with third-party applications that may need a text condensation or summarization system, apart from providing its own interface that users can utilize to summarize documents.

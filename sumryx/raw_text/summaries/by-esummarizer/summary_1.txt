Text summarization is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which can be described as the process of creating a compressed representation of a text document which conveys the main ideas of the document (Tohalino & Amancio, 2017).For a given document containing of a set of sentences S, the aim of extractive text summarization is to select top k sentences that covers the main idea expressed in that document (Nikolov, Pfieffer & Hahnloser, 2018).Extractive text summarization selects  a set of sentences from a document that conveys the main ideas expressed in that document and uses it as its summary.This project seeks to develop a text summarization model that would be able to condense documents to a shorter and more readable form by extracting sentences representing the key ideas that are expressed in the documents in order to significantly reduce the amount of time spent generating summaries (manually) and also searching for information .Although the model used for summarization performs single document summarization, the entire system can generate summaries for multiple documents one at a time.
